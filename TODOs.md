# Useful

- Create config file using wizard
- Dialog for modifying settings
- Document code ;-)

# Optimizations

- Caching EXIF Data for faster loading, harmonizing image and EXIF load
- Perhaps have pictures load in a separate thread for better responsiveness
- Maybe keep the MRU path in conf and start loading from there

# Nice to have features

- Capture date/time correction
- Auto-renaming pictures according to date/time

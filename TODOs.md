# Useful

- Document code ;-)
- Option for auto-adding first level directories of pictures path to temporary target list
- Photo ranges (start range, end range, Ctrl+T adds date span to target dir name)
- Customizable FOTOSORT-TRASH location
- Ctrl+Home / Ctrl+End for jumping to beginning / end of all pictures
- Show image total and current
- Image markers for fast jumping

# Optimizations

- Caching EXIF Data for faster loading, harmonizing image and EXIF load
- Perhaps have pictures load in a separate thread for better responsiveness
- Maybe keep the MRU path in conf and start loading from there

# Nice to have features

- Capture date/time correction
- Auto-renaming pictures according to date/time
